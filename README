icetotgd: Convert icetv's guide to Topfield TGD format.


* Running

To run, at the command line:
% python icetotgd.py

This will create a TGD file for every day of data. These TGD files
can then be uploaded to the Topfield (e.g. via Altair or Topfield ftpd)
and used by EPGupload or JustEPG.


* Source code

Source code is available on http://repo.or.cz/w/xmltvtotgd.git where
it can be downloaded (in .tar.gz or .zip format) or cloned (with git)
which I suggest you do if you want to muck around and submit patches.

You can run the unit tests directly
% python test_icetotgd.py
or with nosetests
% nosetests

* Known bugs

** icetv's guide is in UTC, and is crudely converted to AEST,
   this needs to be nicer.

** TGD files are appended to - this probably isn't necessary,
   because the ice guide is in sequence, but it means they
   should be empty or nonexistent before this converter is run.

** The data in TGD files needs to be sorted, something like this:
   % for f in *tgd ; sort -n $f > z/$f
