Convert icetv's guide to Topfield TGD format.

* Known bugs

** icetv's guide is in UTC, and is crudely converted to AEST,
   this needs to be nicer.

** TGD files are appended to - this probably isn't necessary,
   because the ice guide is in sequence, but it means they
   should be empty or nonexistent before this converter is run.
